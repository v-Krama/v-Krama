🎓 **AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate**  
🌍 **IELTS Certified** for English proficiency  
💡 **Core Expertise:** Cloud Computing, Ethical Hacking, Python with AI, Web Scraping

My diverse background—from a Robotics Bootcamp and Adex apprenticeship to roles as a barista and barber—has instilled in me precision, customer service, and creativity. I actively seek internships or job opportunities to apply my skills, learn continuously, and contribute to innovative projects.
